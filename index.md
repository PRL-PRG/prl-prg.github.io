> We believe that writing computer programs is the fundamental act of computer
> science, and that programming languages are therefore our fundamental tool.

We seek a deeper understanding of programming languages and how it should be
used, and we seek to apply this understanding to the program design process, as
well as to novel applications.

We take a multi-faceted approach to the study of programming languages and
programming methodology, incorporating elements of design, mathematics,
experimental science, and engineering.

We conduct research on all aspects of programming, including:
                                                    
- the development of small and large programs
- the design, implementation, and analysis of programming languages
- programming environment tools

Programming languages are our interface to the machines that carry out
computation on our behalf. Eighty years after the invention of the lambda
calculus, thousands of different computer languages are in daily use.

Programming languages started out closely tracking the hardware on which they
ran. Nowadays, they provide high-level abstractions designed to closely match
the problem domains of their user base. Consider the following domains of
application that have given rise to dedicated language technologies:

- Web programming: much of the interactions while browsing the web today is
  programmed in JavaScript, a dedicated language designed to be wholly portable,
  have limited capabilities and allow for rapid development. But over the 20
  years since its inception, it has become clear that JavaScript is not capable
  of supporting large projects – web sites are increasingly complex software
  systems.

- Data analytics: analyzing complex data has been the bread and butter of the
  likes of S-Plus and later R as well as Matlab. These systems have distinctive
  characteristics that include, for example, support for vectorization and
  missing observations. However, thorough analysis of R has revealed a number of
  weaknesses in performance and scalability. New language such as Julia and
  Spark are starting to address those.

- Secure programming: assurance against malicious code and against loss of
  secrecy or privacy are growing in importance as the societal cost of security
  breaches is becoming more severe. Security can be incorporated as an integral
  part of the language as in the Jif extension to Java, or the PI’s JSLocker
  extension to JavaScript. However, achieving secure programming through
  programming languages still remain a constant cat-and-mouse game between
  attackers and language designers.

- Probabilistic programming: a foundational technology for machine learning
  requires linguistic abstractions that match the appropriate computational
  model (e.g. graphical models and Bayesian networks). Languages like Church
  provide built-in support for probabilistic programming while other projects
  extend languages like Excel.

## About

Programming languages are the interface between people and the machines that
carry out computation on their behalf. As such, programming languages are
fundemantal tools of computing science.

Therefore, we believe that existing languages should be studied deeply, to
understand their applications, design process, and their impact on both the
programming ecosystem, as well as the programmers' way of thinking.

Armed with this knowledge we strive to improve programming languages and
develop their ecosystems to be efficient at their tasks, ergonomic, and
well-suited to their domains.

We do this using a multi-faceted approach incorporating elements of design,
mathematics, experimental science, and engineering.

We focus our efforts on JavaScript and R, dynamic languages used ubiquitously
in their respective fields of web programming and data science, whose
performance affects millions of users. We also have an interest in new and
up-comming languages like Julia, which can become stars in their fields and
make areas of computing faster and easier.

## Join the lab

If you are interested in programming languages and would like to try your hand
at programming language research, we encourage you to contact us at [ck@cs.uni-salzburg.at](mailto:ck@cs.uni-salzburg.at) or
[j.vitek@neu.edu](mailto:j.vitek@neu.edu).

We are constantly looking for smart and enthusiastic people, and may have
openings for Bachelor, Master, PhD students, and Post-Doc researchers.

You can find more details regarding interesting project ideas
[here](student-projects.html), or let us know if you have a PL project you
would like to work on.

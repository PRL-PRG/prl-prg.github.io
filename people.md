    - Joined Purdue, 1999
    - PhD, University of Geneva, 1999
    - MSc, University of Victoria, 1995
    note: "I work on the design and implementation of programming languages. I led the implementation of the first real-time Java virtual machine to be flight-tested. With Noble and Potter, I proposed what became known as Ownership Types.  I tried to understand JavaScript by dynamic analysis and am now looking at supporting scalable data analysis in R."

    note: "I am interested in typed functional programming languages, type theory, mathematics of program construction. In the past I worked for better software engineering principles of building a computer algebra software in C++, especially using what C++ world knows as generic programming. For now I'm mostly working on a principled approach to the Julia programming language."

  - name: Evolving Language Ecosystems (ELE)
    description: "The Evolving Language Ecosystems project explores the fundamental techniques and algorithms for evolving programming languages and their ecosystems. Our purpose is to reduce the cost of wide-ranging language changes and obviate the need for devising entirely new languages. Our findings will grant both researchers and practitioners a greater degree of freedom when experimenting with new ideas on how to express computation."

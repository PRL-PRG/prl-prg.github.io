## Evolving Language Ecosystems (ELE)

The Evolving Language Ecosystems project explores the fundamental techniques and
algorithms for evolving programming languages and their ecosystems. Our purpose
is to reduce the cost of wide-ranging language changes and obviate the need for
devising entirely new languages. Our findings will grant both researchers and
practitioners a greater degree of freedom when experimenting with new ideas on
how to express computation.

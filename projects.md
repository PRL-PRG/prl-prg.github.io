## Evolving Language Ecosystems (ELE)

The Evolving Language Ecosystems project explores the fundamental techniques and
algorithms for evolving programming languages and their ecosystems. Our purpose
is to reduce the cost of wide-ranging language changes and obviate the need for
devising entirely new languages. Our findings will grant both researchers and
practitioners a greater degree of freedom when experimenting with new ideas on
how to express computation.

This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research 
and innovation programme under grant agreement No 695412.

## Big Code: Scalable Analysis of Massive Code Bases

Computer code is increasingly a shared resource. Web sites such as GitHub and
BitBucket host tens of millions of software projects. With great amounts of
code, come great opportunities and challenges.The Big Code project aims to
automatically extract insights from large code bases by a combination of static
program analysis and machine learning. The purpose of the project is to address
three challenge problems: language ecosystem evolution, predictive workload
performance modelling, synthesis of personalized programming hints.

This project is supported from The Czech Operational Programme "Research, 
Development, and Education, under grant agreement No. 
CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000421.
